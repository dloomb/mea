##Setup

####JAVA8_HOME
printicular-android uses Java 8 and a thirdparty tool called Retrolambda (For back compat with other Java versions).
This means you must have a environment variable set for JAVA8_HOME which points to your version of Java 8.

This can be different for each machine, hence the enviornment variable.
***Mac** might look like this ```/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home```

***Windows** might look like this ```C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_60```
